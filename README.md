### Hi there, my name is Gabriel Villalobos ðŸ‘‹
<hr/>
 I'm an organized, compassionate, and collaborative individual with a passion for full-stack development. Recently graduated from a rigorous bootcamp, I honed my skills in JavaScript, React-Redux, Sequelize, Express, and more. My journey has taught me the importance of teamwork and giving back to the community.

 With a strong commitment to creating impactful projects, I thrive in collaborative environments where diverse perspectives come together to drive innovation. I firmly believe that the best solutions are born out of cooperation, not competition. I approach every challenge with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others.
